Ateles implements a discontinuous Galerkin solver with explicit time integration
and arbitrary high spatial scheme orders for various equation systems.
It exploits the cubical elements by using efficient dimension by dimension
algorithms.
Its main application domain are compressible flows.

Its public `source code repository`_ is hosted on OSDN.
Please see the `documentation`_ for its usage and more details.

Ateles are also known as `spider monkeys`_ [extern] and are one of the fastest monkeys
living in trees.
