The Aotus library provides a Fortran wrapper to the `Lua`_ [extern] C-API and various
convenience functions to ease the use of Lua scripts for the definition of
parameters in Fortran applications.
This part is completely independent of the other tools in APES and can easily
be used on its own.

Its public `source code repository`_ is hosted on OSDN.
Please see the `documentation`_ for its usage and more details.

Aotus is the `Night Monkey`_ [extern]. For APES it talks to the moon (Lua).
All tools of APES use Aotus to read configuration files.
