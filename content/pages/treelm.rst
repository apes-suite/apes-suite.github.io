TreElM is the core library of APES providing the mechanisms to work with the
octree mesh.
It enables the implementation of stencil-based algorithms on the mesh by taking
care of the neighborhood identification in a parallel environment.

Its public `source code repository`_ is hosted on OSDN.
Please see the `documentation`_ for its usage and more details.
